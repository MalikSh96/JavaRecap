# Announcement
I am trying my best to provide the source for my knowlegde through showing which links I have been using, on top 
of what I already knew and had done in previous projects.

# WHAT AM I DOING you might wanna ask
I am working on refreshing my knowledge around programming in java.\
Refreshing the knowledge about what I know about entity classes and how to create them.\
Refreshing my knowledge about how to work with JPA and JPQL and also how to use DTO and what their purpose is.\
Refreshing my knowledge about how to write OOP, Object Orientated Programming, not that I have forgotten it ;).\
Refreshing my knowledge about how to generate a persistence unit, which dependencies I need to use and plugins.\
Dependencies and plugins such as gson, json, mysql, junit, hamcrest, mindrot, nimbuds, jersey etc..\
Refreshing my knowledge about how to use the EntityManager.

# WHAT HAVE I DONE SO FAR 
Made a persistence unit.\
Made an Entity class of type UserInformation.\
Made a "backend" folder that contains a Users.java class to maintain work back and forth between the database.\
So far I have implemented the necessary dependencies and plugins.\
Made a dto folder that handles filtered data through the UserInformationDTO.java.\
In the "tester" folder I have made a Test.java class which contains a "main" method, this is just to purely test if the code works.\
Made a "converter" folder which should convert object to json and json to object.

# WHAT ARE MY NEXT STEPS you may need to know
My next steps would to be implementing a bit more functionality to the already existing code.\
Work to implement REST Api's using the "jersey" dependency and implementing CRUD calls, likely using Postman.\
Use gson and json to transform data back and forth.\
Make some jUnit test.

# OBS!
This is just a side project to refresh all that I know from before and to implement new knowledge.\
With that said, if time allows it I could work to implement a frontend to this project too, as my current plan is 
to just let this remain as a backend stuff, with a middle layer to handle data.
